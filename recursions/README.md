#### Intro to Recursions

- what's recursion? a way of solving a problem by having a function calling itself
- real life example of recursion is an russian figure doll

- repeating the process until you get to the smallest problem that cannot be solved, basically breaking it down, while trying to make the problem smaller and smaller
- performing the same operation multiple times with diff inputs
- an infinite loop will occur, so a base condition is needed to stop the recursion

##### recursion joke
- a programmer wife tells him as he leaves the house: "while you're out, buy some milk". He never returns home and the universe runs out of milk.

### Why Recursion
- easy to read and write
- always breaking down
- difference between loop and recursion
- done when we have chance to breakdown
- only if a smaller problem is similar to its bigger problem
- extendedly used in tree and graphs.
- also used in several algorithm

### How recursions works internally?

 - 1. a method calls itsef
 - 2. exit from infinite loop
